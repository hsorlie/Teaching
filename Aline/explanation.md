A straight line on a plane is defined by two parameters: the intercept (a) and the slope (b). By setting these two parameters, any straight line can be described. The intercept determines where the slope intercepts the y-axis, hence the name. The slope determines... well, the slope of the line. That is, for every increment along the x-axis, how much will the corresponding value on the y-axis increase.
