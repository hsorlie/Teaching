This app draws two random normal samples which are correlated approximately as specified by the drop-down menu. The purpose is to get a feel for how different scatterplots look at different values of r. Also, the slider lets you introduce one outlier, so you can see how this outlier affects the relationship between two variables that are highly correlated, or not correlated at all.
