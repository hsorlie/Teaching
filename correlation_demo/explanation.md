This app draws a sample (random, normal, n = 200) with two variables (x and y) which are correlated approximately as specified by the drop-down menu. The purpose is to get a feel for how different scatterplots look at different values of r. The strength of the correlation (Pearson's r) is shown in the top left corner.  

Also, the sliders lets you determine the values of x and y for one data point, to introduce an outlier. The takeaway should be how sensitive correlation coefficients are to extreme outliers. One such outlier can completely destroy an otherwise perfect correlation in a dataset, or introduce a strong correlation where data are otherwise unrelated.
