First, try experimenting with number of throws, with only one die per throw. The range of possible total values for a throw is now 1-6. There is a 1/6 chance of getting a 1, a 1/6 chance of getting a 2.. etc. And a 1/6 chance of getting a 6. This seems obvious, but the notable point is this: Since there is only one die, there is only one possible way to get a total value of 1; namely, getting that 1 on your only die. With one die in your hand there is also only one possible way to get a total value of 2 for your entire hand, only one way to get a 3, and so on. Since each possible total outcome is equally likely, the outcomes will tend to happen about as often. For large numbers of throws, this will show as the bars representing the number of times you have obtained each total value will look increasingly equal in height.

With two dice in your hand per throw, this changes. The range of possible total values is not 1-6 since there are two dice, but rather 2-12. There is only one way of obtaining a total value of 2: Getting a 1 on both your dice. Equally, the only way to get a total value of 12 involves getting 6 on both your dice. However, there are two possible ways in which you can get a total value of 3: You can either get a 1 and a 2, or you can get a 2 and a 1. These are not identical ways. There are also two different ways of getting an 11: A 5 and a 6, or a 6 and a 5. Similarly, there are even more different ways to get a total value of 4 and the following three combinations will get you there: 1-3, 2-2 and 3-1. Getting a total value of 5 can happen in four ways: 1-4, 2-3, 3-2, 4-1. And so on. 7 is the total value which can happen in most different ways. But since each value on *one* die is equally likely to happen, we can expect the outcome 1-2 to happen about as often as 1-1. However, we can also expect 2-1 (which is different from 1-2) to happen as often as 1-1 as well. Since 1-2 and 2-1 results in the same total value, we can expect the total value 3 to occur about twice as often as the total value 2, which can come about is half as many different ways. Try it, with two dice per throw, and a large number of throws.

This far, our distribution looks more like a pyramid than the famous bell-shaped curve of the normal distribution. The black line is the theoretical normal ditribution for the corresponding mean value and standard deviation, but not dependent on the actual throwing of the dice.

With three dice per hand, the pyramid shape is gone and the distribution is starting to take on that bell shape. Again, the bars show actual throwing of dice (or the randomization equivalent done in programming language) and is simulated anew each time. When you set the slider to 10 dice and 10.000 throws, the actual throwing of 10 dice 10.000 times is actually simulated each time. Therefore, the plot will look a bit different each time, but for large numbers of throws the height of the bar represents the chance of getting that total value compared to the other total values. And therefore, based on the reasoning above, it represents the number of different ways in which it is possible to obtain this total value.

The main takeaway is this: **Outcomes that can happen in more different ways are generally more likely to happen than outcomes that can happen in different fewer ways.**

And now, enter the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that outcomes that... (WIP)
