**First, try throwing one die one time** (both sliders at 1), and repeat a few times just to get a feeling for the plot. With one die, the range of possible total values for a throw is 1-6, as can be seen on the X-axis. So if you throw *one* die, the plot will show *one* blue bar with a height of 1 (the number of times you got that result) for the value shown on that die. **Now, change the bottom slider to a slightly larger number.** The range of the X-axis stays the same, but the bars now represent how many times you got a 1, how many times you got a 2, etc.

**Experiment with number of throws, keeping the number of dice per throw at 1.** If the die is fair (it is. I promise.) there is a 1/6 chance of getting a 1, a 1/6 chance of getting a 2.. etc, and a 1/6 chance of getting a 6. This seems obvious, but we are interested in the total value obtained per throw, and the notable point is this: *Since there is only one die, there is only one possible way to get a total value per throw of 1*; namely, getting that 1 on your only die. With one die in your hand there is also only one possible way to get a total value of 2 for your throw, only one way to get a total value of 3, and so on. Since each possible total outcome is equally likely, the outcomes will tend to happen about as often. So as the number of throws start to get large, the bars will look increasingly equal in height.

**With two dice in your hand per throw, this changes.** First: The range of possible total values per throw is no longer 1-6, since there are two dice, but rather 2-12. This is now reflected on the X-axis. But are all possible outcomes equally likely, as they were with one die? There is only one possible way of obtaining a total value of 2: You will need to get a 1 on both your dice. Equally, the only way to get a total value of 12 is getting 6 on both your dice.

However, there are two possible ways in which you can get a total value of 3: You can either get a 1 and a 2, or you can get a 2 and a 1. These are not identical ways, since the outcome for each individual die is different. There are also two different ways of getting an 11: A 5 and a 6, or a 6 and a 5. Similarly, there are even more different ways to get a total value of 4. The following three combinations will get you there: 1-3, 2-2 and 3-1. Getting a total value of 5 can happen in four different ways: 1-4, 2-3, 3-2, 4-1. And so on. 7 is the total value which can come about in most different ways (there are six possibilities).

But back to the total values 2 and 3, which had one (1-1) and two different ways (1-2 and 2-1), respectively, of coming about. Since each of the six values on *one* die is equally likely to happen, each individual combination of values (there are $6*6=36$ combinations) is equally likely. 1-1, 3-6, 6-2, 3-4 etc. are all equally likely to happen. Thus, we can expect the outcome 1-2 to happen about as often as 1-1. However, we can also expect 2-1 (which is different from 1-2) to happen as often as 1-1 as well. Since 1-2 and 2-1 results in the same *total* value, we can expect the total value 3 to occur about twice as often as the total value 2, which can come about in half as many different ways. Try it, with two dice per throw, and a large number of throws.

The main takeaway so far is this: **Outcomes that can come about in more different ways are generally more likely than outcomes that can come about in fewer different ways.**

This far, our distribution of obtained values looks like a pyramid, not the famous bell-shaped curve of the normal distribution. **With three dice per hand**, the pyramid shape is gone and the distribution is starting to take on that bell shape.

The blue bars show actual throwing of dice (or the randomization equivalent done in programming language) and is simulated anew each time. When you set the slider to 10 dice and 20.000 throws, the actual repeated throwing of 10 dice 20.000 times is actually simulated, each time. Therefore, the plot will look a bit different each time, but for large numbers of throws the height of the bar represents the chance of getting that total value compared to the other total values. And therefore, based on the reasoning above, it represents the number of different ways in which it is possible to obtain this total value. The black line is the theoretical normal distribution for the corresponding mean value and standard deviation, but not dependent on the actual throwing of the dice. 

And now, enter the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that outcomes that... (WIP)
