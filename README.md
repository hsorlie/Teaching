# Teaching

This is where I will collect the resources I use myself for teaching.

Not much here at the moment, but I suppose it's a place to grow.

1. My methods lectures have so far been done mostly in Keynote, so they're not here. However, as part of those lectures I have wanted to explain the central limit theorem to the students. I have now made a Shiny app for that purpose. You'll find the source code in the folder "Demo-Sentralgrenseteoremet", but you can check it out live here: https://hsorlie.shinyapps.io/Demo-Sentralgrenseteoremet/

2. I've held a 3-hour "Intro to R" workshop. Materials is in the folder "Intro til R". Everything is in norwegian. If the opportunity arises I'll hold the workshop again, and if so I'll update the materials.
