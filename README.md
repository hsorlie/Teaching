# Teaching Resources

This is where I will collect the resources I use myself for teaching.

Not much here at the moment, but I suppose it's a place to grow.

1. My methods lectures have so far been done mostly in Keynote, so they're not here. However, as part of those lectures I have wanted to explain a few things interactively, so I have made tiny Shiny apps for that purpose:
        - **The central limit theorem**, illustrated by throwing dice. You'll find the source code in the folder "Demo-Sentralgrenseteoremet", but you can check it out live here: https://hsorlie.shinyapps.io/Demo-Sentralgrenseteoremet/
        - As an intro to linear regression, I wanted to make sure everybody was onboard with the concept of **two parameters defining a straight line**. Source code in the folder "Aline", and the app is live here: https://hsorlie.shinyapps.io/Aline/
2. I held a 3-hour **"Intro to R" workshop.** The materials I used is in the folder "Intro til R". Everything is in norwegian. So far I have just dumped everything I used in that folder, and it is not necessarily self-explanatory or suited for use by anyone else. However, if the opportunity arises to hold the workshop again and I need to update the materials, I'll do so with reusability, not necessarily by me, in mind.
