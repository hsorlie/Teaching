# Teaching Resources

This is where I collect the resources I use myself for teaching.

Not much here at the moment, but I suppose it's a place to grow.

1. Currently preparing a workshop on **Collaborative writing with papaja in R**, to be held in late february. Materials [in this folder](/papaja_workshop), as they are developed.  

1. My methods lectures have so far been done mostly in Keynote, so they're not here. I have, however, recorded my **"Basic descriptive statistics" lecture, so [that video is here](https://fhs.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d9e92689-c36e-4304-8fc1-ab4a00c38831) (in norwegian)**. I'll consider recording other lectures as well, but it hasn't been a priority. Also, as part of those lectures I have wanted to explain a few things interactively, so I have made tiny Shiny apps for that purpose:  

    - **The central limit theorem**, illustrated by throwing dice. [You'll find the source code here](/Demo-Sentralgrenseteoremet), and you can [check it out live here](https://hsorlie.shinyapps.io/Demo-Sentralgrenseteoremet/)  
        
    - As an intro to linear regression, I wanted to make sure everybody was onboard with the concept of **two parameters defining a straight line**. [The code is here](/Aline), and [you can find the app here.](https://hsorlie.shinyapps.io/Aline/)  
    
    - This is to **demo different correlation** strengths, to get a feel for how the scatterplots look at different values of r, and how outliers affect that relationship. [Source code here](/correlation_demo) and the [app is here.](https://hsorlie.shinyapps.io/correlation_demo/)
        
2. I held a 3-hour **"Intro to R" workshop.** The materials I used is in [this folder](/intro_to_R). Everything is in norwegian. So far I have just dumped everything I used in that folder, and it is not necessarily self-explanatory or suited for use by anyone else. However, if the opportunity arises to hold the workshop again and I need to update the materials, I'll do so with reusability, not necessarily by me, in mind.  

3. I was asked to make a **video to demo [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org) and [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org)**, to students and researchers who might consider switching from SPSS. [That video is here](https://fhs.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=76e17bcf-2a02-4be8-8bbb-ab49009c420e) (in norwegian).

4. After this I wanted to make a similar **video to demo [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)**, to encourage students and researchers to start using it, and perhaps make the switch from Endnote. [That video is here](https://fhs.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=480458de-be2f-4877-b95a-ab5200c22ee4) (in norwegian).
